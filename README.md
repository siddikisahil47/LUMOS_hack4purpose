Our project, LUMOS, revolutionizes food analysis to empower users with informed choices tailored to their health needs. Through real-time analysis of food, LUMOS provides personalized recommendations based on individual health profiles. But we don't stop there â€“ we introduce gamification to enhance user engagement. Users can step counts but also foster a supportive community focused on wellness. With gamification at its core, our platform offers multiple activities, games, and progress tracking, creating an immersive experience that encourages active participation and promotes healthier food consumption.
